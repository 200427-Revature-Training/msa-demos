# Feign Client

Feign client is a tool built by Netflix for sending HTTP requests in a Microservices application. Feign integrates with Spring MVC and allows us to create interfaces which look like Spring MVC controllers but are used to describe a remote controller rather than a local controller.

Note: Feign Clients must be enabled using @EnableFeignClients
